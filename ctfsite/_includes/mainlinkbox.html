        <h2 class="ui header">How does TJCTF work?</h2>
        TJCTF is simple. Your team is given 4 days to solve as many of the ~30 provided challenges as possible. The object of each challenge is to find a short string called the "flag" by solving a computer security puzzle. You'll know when you've found it. Each flag you find earns you points and the teams with the most points win.
