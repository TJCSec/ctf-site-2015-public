There are a number of ways you can prepare for TJCTF. First and foremost, make sure you have access to a linux machine. Many of the binaries we will distribute will only run on certain architectures. If you do not already have an installation, you can install a virtual machine under [VMware player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player) or [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). I would recommend installing either good 'ol [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download), or the more powerful [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).

Once you have familiarized yourself with these platforms, there are a couple places you can visit for practice. [PicoCTF](http://picoctf.org) has two years worth of challenges that you can try by signing up on their site. [Smash the stack](http://smashthestack.org/) is another great platform for practicing, with a variety of challenges for you to try. And as with any ctf, remember that google is your best friend.
